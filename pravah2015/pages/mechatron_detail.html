<strong>PRIZE : INR 10,000</strong><br><br>
<br><b>Task:</b>
<br>1. Teams must build a manually controlled machine which can do simple task of gripping blocks and putting them in deposit zones so that it can exit the arena by overcoming the discontinuity in the ramp.
<br>2. The bot can be wired or wireless. In case the participants use wireless mechanism, they must use dual frequency remote.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Arena:</b>
<br><p>To be declared.....</p>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Bot Specifications:</b>
<br>1. The dimensions of the bot should be less than or equal to 300 mm X 300 mm X 300 mm at the start of the game failing which the team will be disqualified from the competition. However the bot can extend its dimension once the run starts.
<br>2. The bot should be controlled manually.
<br>3. Teams can use both wired as well as wireless control mechanisms. In case of wired bots, the length of wire should be minimum 2 meters so that the wire remains slack at any instant of time. If the participants use wireless mechanism then it is mandatory to use a dual frequency remote.
<br>4. The dimensions of the remote are not included in the size constraint of the bot.
<br>5. Bot must have an on-board power supply in any case.
<br>6. Participants are not supposed to use any readymade lego components or readymade gripping mechanism. However the participants are allowed to use readymade gear assemblies. Violating this clause will lead to immediate disqualification of the team.
<br>7. Irrespective of the mechanism used, only one person will be allowed to control the bot.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Power Supply:</b>
<br>1. The participants should use an onboard electric or non-electric power supply i.e. the power source should be on the bot itself. The power source must be non-polluting and must satisfy the safety constraints determined by the organisers. In case of non-electric power supply, the participants must get it approved from the organisers beforehand via email. Organisers are not responsible for the inconvenience if the approval is not sought.
<br>2. In case of an electric power supply, the voltage between any two points should be less than or equal to 24 V DC at all times during the run.
<br>3. AC power supply will not be provided at the time of the competition.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Gameplay:</b>
<br>1. The bot must start from the START line.
<br>2. The bot has to keep any two blocks in the deposit zones marked in green colour in the arena. Only one block is to be kept per deposit zone. Bot is not allowed to slide any block outside the deposit zone.
<br>3. The bot is allowed to pick only one block at a time. Order of the blocks to be picked is left completely at the discretion of the participants.
<br>4. The block must be placed completely in the deposit zone.
<br>5. The bot has to place the remaining two blocks (one at a time) over the platform created by the two blocks in the deposit zones and a block connecting the two ramps. These two blocks should be placed by climbing the bridge and in such a way that they fill the gap and allow the bot to cross over.
<br>6. The bot should cross the ramp and reach the FINISH line overcoming the speed-breakers.
<br>
<br><b>Certificate Policy:</b>
<br>1. Top three teams will qualify to the finale and will be awarded Certificate of Excellence for the wildcard round.
<br>2. Certificate of participation will be given to the top 50% teams.
