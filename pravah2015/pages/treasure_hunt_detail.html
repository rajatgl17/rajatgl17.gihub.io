<p><em>If you’re a person who loves solving riddles, if the word “adventure” makes adrenaline rush through your body, if you want to explore the campus or just want to make some new friends – treasure hunt is what might catch your fancy. Treasure hunt is a team game that is quite popular in colleges throughout the world and our SKIT COLLEGE is no exception. As the name suggests, in treasure hunt, you’re supposed to hunt down the “treasures”. It’s the very first team activity with prize money that a fresher participates in . The Freshers’ Treasure Hunt is organized jointly by FUN CLUB and PRAVAH .<br><br>

Each team (consisting usually of 4 members) is given a clue, which when deciphered, divulges a location in the campus which has the next clue. This way, the team deciphering all the codes at the earliest is deemed the winner. Working out the mind-benders, deceptive discussions to lead other teams to the wrong locations, “overhearing” the other teams ( always huddle your team while discussing confidential stuff to save yourself from this) – the fun and drama is exhilarating.<br><br>

At the end of the day it’s more about how much fun you had rather than how well you did.<br><br>

Treasure hunt is an excellent way to have an upbeat time with friends (and possibly earn some bucks).<br><br>

According to nikhil, a member of the winning team of last year’s ’ Treasure Hunt,- “One realizes the importance of teamwork, learns never to give up, and that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. It is something that everyone should try to take part in.” And even if you botch it all up, you’ll get to interact with some new people and possibly make some pals. So, it’s a win win situation in any case.<br><br>

To start off, your team is handed a list of things to be found. This is the scavenger hunt.<br><br>

.Then, if your team collects enough items to clear the cutoff after the scavenger hunt, you are just a PIRATE! The treasure hunt kicks off, and you’re given the first clue. The clue will be cryptic and once you break the code, it’ll lead you to some location in the campus. Hence, this is the perfect opportunity for you newbies to get lost and explore the huge, huge and beautiful campus we have! The clues will lead you to places where you’ve never been before, in fact to many places you’ve never heard of before, even.<br><br>


It’ll take you some time to figure out each clue. Sit with your teammates and apply your brains to decrypt the clue and you’ll have some of the most wonderful moments. At every point you will have to do some simple task like playing dumb charades, solving some word games, maybe even playing a bit of football! The treasure hunt will continue till 6 PM (sometimes, even later). And you’re sure to have some amazing memories of the treasure hunt, regardless of whether you win or not. This is definitely one event in which participation and the journey is completely worth it.<br><br>

So listen up people, don’t miss the treasure hunt. It’s an excuse to make new friends and explore as much of the campus as you can while having a lot of fun. So hope your adventurers will turn up in huge numbers for the event.</em></p>
