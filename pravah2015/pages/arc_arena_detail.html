<strong>Arena:</strong><br><br>The game field consists of an arena having dimensions 1770mm X 1770mm.<br><br>The width of all white stripes will be 30mm.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Gameplay: </strong><br><ol><br>	<li>The gameplay consists of two parts.</li><br>	<li>The first part is the dry run. In this part the bot must start from the start zone and find its way to reach out to astroid zone of the arena. The bot will be given a maximum of 5 minutes to reach t o the astroid zone . The bot has to follow an algorithm to find its path to reach astroid zone</li><br>	<li>The second part consists of to destroy the astroid before reaches to time</li><br>	<li>Timer will start as soon as the bot has start zone</li><br>	<li>The bot has to complete the task in minimum possible time.</li><br></ol><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Bot specifications</strong><br><ol><br>	<li>The autonomous bot must fit into the box of dimension 250mm×250mm×250mm</li><br>	<li>Bot must be started individually by only one switch. However a team may have on-board switch for restart. This switch has to be shown to the organiser before the run. .</li><br>	<li>During the run, the autonomous bot must not damage the arena in any way. It is not allowed to leave anything behind or make any marks while traversing the arena. Any bot found damaging the arena will be immediately disqualified. The final decision is at the discretion of the organisers.</li><br>	<li>Bot must have on board power supply.</li><br>	<li>When using the electric power supply, the potential difference between any 2 points must not exceed 12 V at any point of time during the game.</li><br>	<li>The autonomous bot should not separate or split into two or more units. All bots/units which are touching each other or are in the starting point will be considered as one bot.</li><br>	<li>Machine cannot be constructed using readymade Lego kits or any readymade mechanism. But they can make use of readymade gear assemblies. Violating this clause will lead to disqualification of the team.</li><br></ol><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Game Rules: </strong><br><br>The teams will have to submit their bot before the start of the competition. Only those teams which submit their bots will be allowed to participate. The bot will be handed back to the team during the time of their run. They will be given 1 minute for calibration. If any team is found to alter its code after depositing its bots, then it will be immediately disqualified from the competition. They are however allowed to make any other hardware changes.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><ol><br>	<li>Only one autonomous bot per team is allowed.</li><br>	<li>When the autonomous bot starts, no team member is allowed to touch the bot.</li><br>	<li>At the start of the task, the bot will be placed at the starting point. Only 1 member from the team is allowed to be near the game field while starting the bot.</li><br>	<li>Run will start only when the organizer gives the signal.</li><br>	<li>The starting procedure of the bot should be simple and should not involve giving bot any manual force or impulse in any direction.</li><br></ol><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Restarts: </strong><br><ol><br>	<li>The participants are allowed to take a maximum of 3 restarts in the entire match.</li><br>	<li>If the bot takes a restart in the first part of the competition, it has to start from the starting line.</li><br>	<li>If the bot takes a restart in the second part of the competition, it has to start from the centre of the arena.</li><br>	<li>The timer will not be set back to zero and will not be paused.</li><br>	<li>During a restart, a contestant must not feed information about the arena to the bot. However, contestants are allowed to adjust sensors (gain, position etc.) and make hardware changes.</li><br>	<li>The contestant must not alter the bot in any manner that reduces its weight .</li><br></ol><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Team Specifications:</strong><br><br>A team may consist of a maximum of 4 participants. Students from different educational institutes can form a team.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Eligibility: </strong><br><br>All students with a valid identity card of their respective educational institutes are eligible to participate.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>General Rules: </strong><br><ol><br>	<li>Only 1 member of the team is allowed to handle the bot.</li><br>	<li>Participants are not allowed to keep anything inside the arena other than the bot.</li><br>	<li>Laptops/personal computers are not allowed near the arena. Other Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. devices must be switched off. The organisers hold the right to check for these devices and their usage and disqualify the team.</li><br>	<li>The time measured by the organisers will be final and will be used for scoring the teams.</li><br>	<li>Time measured by any contestant by any other means is not acceptable for scoring.</li><br>	<li>In case of any disputes / discrepancies, the organisers' decision will be final and binding.</li><br>	<li>The organisers reserve the rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit.
