<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Drub Charades- Finger on your lips"</em></p>
<br><em>It is general and our favourite game, we practice it all the time... For example, asking pen from your friend in class without giving even a single hint to your professor. We are born with shrewdness and extempore skills. Now is just the time to collect all the television knowledge, rejuvenate our skills and feel the excitement of cracking clues and sometimes even missing them by nano seconds. Letâ€™s play Dumb Charade and put our skills to win fabulous prizes..!!</em>
