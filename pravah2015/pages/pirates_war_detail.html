<center><h2>PIRATES WAR: the water battlefield</h2></center>
<br><br>
<p>Captain Jack Sparrow first appears in The Curse of the Black Pearlwhen he arrives in Port Royal to commandeer a ship. Despite rescuing Elizabeth Swann, the daughter of Governor Weather by Swann from drowning, he is jailed for piracy. That night, a cursed pirate ship called the Black Pearl attacks Port Royal, kidnapping Elizabeth in the process. Its captain, Hector Barbossa, desperately seeks one last gold coin to break an ancient Aztec curse that he and his crew are under. Will Turner, a blacksmith, frees Sparrow to aid him in rescuing Elizabeth. They commandeer the HMS Interceptor and recruit a motley crew in Tortuga before heading to Isla de Muerta, where Elizabeth is held captive. Along the way, Will learns that Sparrow was the Black Pearl's captain until Barbossa led a mutiny ten years before and took over the ship, marooning Sparrow on an island. Sparrow also tells Turner that his father was a pirate known as "Bootstrap" Bill Turner.</p>
