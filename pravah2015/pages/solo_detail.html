<p style="text-align: center;">"Solo Dancing Competition"</p>
<p><em>Put the language of the soul into action. Dance to the rhythm with your heart to make it a perfect 'one man show'.</em></p>
<p>Dance is the poetry of the foot. Be the part of the most vivacious event of Pravah, Thirak to write a winning one this time. Be it alone or with a partner or in a group, on with the beats and let the joy be unconfined. Experience the spirit of true dancing and a lot more.</p>

<p>Auditions for outsiders will be conducted on 26th Feb at 09:30 AM.</p>
