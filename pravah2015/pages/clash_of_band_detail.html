<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Symphony-Clash of Bands</em></p>
<p>Music is a harbinger of peace, a beacon for love and a motivator of soul. But there's something more that is imbibed in the ethos of the musical culture; rivalry.</p>
<p>While musicians remain true to their genre, their best comes out when they are pitted against each other. And when that happens, the fans are guaranteed a spectacle!</p>
<p>Clash of Bands is one such platform where this spectacle unfolds. The last two editions of COB saw some great artists perform at SKIT Jaipur, but third edition's lineup promises to trump them all.</p>
<p>5 elite bands, thousands of amazing young students and one coveted trophy - all unfolds, this February.</p>
