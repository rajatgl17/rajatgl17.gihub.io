<h3 style="text-align:center;">Vortex : The line follower</h3>
<br><br>
<h3>Task:</h3>
<p>Teams have to build an autonomous robot which can follow white line and going inside the maze. On reaching the center of the arena, the
Bot should glow a LED to complete the task in minimum possible time.</p><br><br>
<h3>Arena:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The game field consists of an arena having dimensions 2020mm X 1790mm.</li>
	<li>The width of all white stripes will be 30mm.</li>
	<li>The figure below shows the sample arena. </li><br>

</ol>
<br><br>
<h3>Bot Specifications:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The bot must be completely autonomous and it must fit into the box of dimension 220mm×220mm×220mm.</li>
	<li>Bot must be started individually by only one switch. However a team may have on-board switch for restart. This switch has to be shown to the organizer before the run.</li>
	<li>Bot must have a red LED which will glow once it reaches the centre of the arena.</li>
	<li>During the run, the autonomous bot must not damage the arena
	In anyway. It is not allowed to leave anything behind or make any marks while traversing the arena. Any bot found damaging the arena will be immediately disqualified. The final decision is at the discretion of the organizers.</li>
	<li>Bot must have on board power supply.</li>
	<li>When using the electric power supply, the potential difference between any 2 points must not exceed 12 V at any point of time during the game.</li>
	<li>The autonomous bot should not separate or split into two or more units. All bots/units which are touching each other or are in the starting point will be considered as one bot.</li>
	<li>Machine cannot be constructed using readymade Lego kits or any readymade mechanism. But they can make use of readymade gear assemblies. Violating this clause will lead to disqualification of the team.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<h3>Game play:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The bot must start from the indicated arrow and find its way to reach the centre of the arena. The bot will be given a maximum of 3 minutes to reach the centre. The bot has to follow an algorithm to find its path.</li>
	<li>There will be given two chances to complete the task; minimum time is taken in count.</li>
	<li>The bot has to complete the task in minimum possible time.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<h3>Game Rules:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The teams will have to submit their bot before the start of the competition. Only those teams which submit their bots will be allowed to participate. The bot will be handed back to the team during the time of their run.</li>
	<li>They will be given a time of 1 minute for calibration. If any team is found to alter its code after depositing its bots, then it will be immediately disqualified from the competition. They are however allowed to make any other hardware changes.</li>
	<li>Only one autonomous bot per team is allowed.</li>
	<li>When the autonomous bot starts, no team member is allowed to touch the bot.</li>
	<li>At the start of the task, the bot will be placed at the starting point
	(Indicated by the arrow). Only 1 member from the team is allowed to be near the game field while starting the bot.</li>
	<li> Run will start only when the organizer gives the signal.</li>
	<li>The starting procedure of the bot should be simple and should not involve giving bot any manual force or impulse in any direction.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<h3>Restarts:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The participants are allowed to take a maximum of  2 restarts in the entire match.</li>
	<li>The timer will not be set back to zero and will not be paused in case of a ‘Restart’</li>
</ol>
