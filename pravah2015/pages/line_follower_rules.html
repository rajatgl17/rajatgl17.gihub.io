<b>Game Rules:</b>
<br><p>The teams will have to submit their bot before the start of the competition. Only those teams which submit their bots will be allowed to participate. The bot will be handed back to the team during the time of their run. They will be given a time of 1 minute for calibration. If any team is found to alter its code after depositing its bots, then it will be immediately disqualified from the competition. They are however allowed to make any other hardware changes.</p>
<br>1. Only one autonomous bot per team is allowed.
<br>2. When the autonomous bot starts, no team member is allowed to touch the bot.
<br>3. At the start of the task, the bot will be placed at the starting point(indicated by the arrow). Only 1 member from the team is allowed to be near the game field while starting the bot.
<br>4. Run will start only when the organizer gives the signal.
<br>5. The starting procedure of the bot should be simple and should not involve giving bot any manual force or impulse in any direction.
<br>6. If the time for the dry run exceeds 3 minutes, then the extra time taken for the dry run will be deducted from the actual run time of 2 minutes. However no advantage will be given if the dry run ends before 3 minutes.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Restarts:</b>
<br>1. The participants are allowed to take a maximum of 3 restarts in the entire match.
<br>2. If the bot takes a restart in the first part of the competition, it has to start from the starting line.
<br>3. If the bot takes a restart in the second part, it has to start from the centre of the arena.
<br>4. The timer will not be set back to zero and will not be paused in case of a ‘Restart’.
<br>5. During a restart, a contestant must not feed information about the arena to the bot. However, contestants are allowed to adjust sensors (gain, position etc.) and make hardware changes.
<br>6. The contestant must not alter the bot in any manner that reduces its weight (e.g. removal of a bulky sensor array or switching to lighter batteries to get better speed). The organisers reserve the right to arbitrate in such circumstances.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>General Rules:</b>
<br>1. Only 1 member of the team is allowed to handle the bot.
<br>2. Participants are not allowed to keep anything inside the arena other than the bot.
<br>3. Laptops/personal computers are not allowed near the arena. Other Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. devices must be switched off. The organisers hold the right to check for these devices and their usage and disqualify the team. The bot should not receive any kind of input from outside the arena.
<br>4. The time measured by the organisers will be final and will be used for scoring the teams.
<br>5. Time measured by any contestant by any other means is not acceptable for scoring.
<br>6. In case of any disputes/discrepancies, the organisers' decision will be final and binding.
<br>7. The organisers reserve the rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit. Change in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered teams.

<br><b>Judging:</b>
<br>1. 30 points will be awarded to reach the centre.
<br>2. 5 points will be awarded if the bot glows LED just after it reaches the centre.
<br>3. 20 points will be awarded every time it goes from inner hexagon to outer hexagon after it reaches the centre. i.e. during the 2nd part of the gameplay.
<br>4. (120-T) points will be awarded if it completed the task successfully (T = time taken by bot to go from the centre of the hexagon to the end of the path).
<br>5. Total score will be sum of all the points mentioned above. Once the bot has reached the centre, the total score will always include the points it acquired to reach the centre successfully irrespective of any restart.
<br>6. Final score will be the maximum of total score attained in any run.
