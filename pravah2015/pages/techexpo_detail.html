Have you ever thought about the person who invented the wheel and kicked off the beginning of human civilisation? Or the people who recently put Rosetta spacecraft on a comet moving at a velocity greater than 135,000 kilometres per hour to discover the genesis of our solar system? Or everything around us that makes our life better? All these people have one thing in common: they all were <strong>Engineers</strong>, and being engineers they believed in contributing their inventions and ideas for the greater good of society. The society relies upon these few daring innovators for its continuous development and endurance against the fury of nature or challenges offered by time. The role of engineers is to give the society what it needs and help its entire generations to rise above their problems.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Any and every civilisation that has ever existed or that might exist will have one common denominator: they all had finest engineers who enabled them to thrive instead of perishing. But what if these engineers would have never showcased their inventions to the society? All those inventions and ideas would have been lost in oblivion.<br><br>Keeping this idea in mind we, the students of SKIT, Jaipur are organising a project exhibition during our annual college festival, PRAVAH 2015. The objective of this endeavour is to present the budding engineers with a platform to showcase their innovations to the world. The event would be visited by industrialists and media channels presenting the participants with an opportunity to attain recognition. If the project of the participant is deemed worthy of being promoted, the visiting industry representatives will give them the chance of developing it as a product, thereby giving them a launching pad for their innovations. Engineering students from distinguished colleges and from all over the country will be participating in the exhibition. Hence, this exhibition is also an opportunity for interacting with the best minds and exchange ideas. So come participate and have the time of your life.
