<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"Rangmanch-Stage Play Competition"</em></p>
<br>“The stage is a magical circle where only the most real things happen, a neutral territory outside the jurisdiction of fate where stars may be crossed with impunity”. So PRAVAH provides you the stage, through the event <em>RANGMANCH</em>, an intercollegiate stage play event for those who have heat and will settle for nothing less than a jam packed stage and highest honour.
