<p class="detail" style="text-indent: 100px; text-align: center;">Social campaigns act as a medium of providing the people a panorama of the social issues. The indian population is not aware of a tone of things occurring in the society and there is a need for them to have knowledge about their own surroundings. They should be acquainted to such serious issues. Here Pravah takes the initiative to spread awareness amongst the youth, the flag bearing leaders. We discuss many issues and then focus on one area, which we think can be addressed through our festival and where we can make a difference, The organizers will not restrict themselves to the student community, they will also help a couple of NGOs. The students will also be taking forward their campaign.</p>
